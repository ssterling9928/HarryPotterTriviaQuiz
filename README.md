This repository contains the complete Xcode project for a Harry Potter-themed trivia game, "Wizards Quiz," which is currently live on the Apple App Store.

The project demonstrates core concepts of native iOS development, including UI design with UIKit, app navigation, and state management.

*A quick note on this repository: This project was completed and published to the App Store before I began using Git for version control. The source code was uploaded here after the fact to showcase the final product.*
